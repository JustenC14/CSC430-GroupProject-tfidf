  This is an attempt at a very basic implementation of TF-IDF to weigh a given
primary, or query web site with a list of given comparison web sites. The idea is to
quickly determine how relevant in content one webpage is to another.


  In it's current state it will simply give you the title of each webpage along with
 its cosine simularity score computation sorted in descending order. This is so most
 relevant pages are at the top.
 
  In the future I would like to add an output file that will display all of the tf, tf_wt
 and other values for the user to look over.
